# mlj_test
Testing of neural network written in Flux.jl vs written in MLJFlux.jl

Download the dataset `atlas_data.csv` at https://mega.nz/file/7sxx3ajJ#cgPEn1LGSutiJTCrNeeoVbuHGclxfYKZL2IhqhzpLHA.

In any case, this dataset is also provided here: https://opendata.cern.ch/record/328

I couldn't upload it here on Github due to it being too large (~200MB). Just put this file in the same directory of the script and it should work.
